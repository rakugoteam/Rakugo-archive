Ren is framemork ( inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) )
<br/> for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

## Story driven games

It means games that are for example:

- Visual Novels

You can use it with:
- GDScript (almost done)
- VisualScript (WIP - I need help)
- RenScript (ToDo)
