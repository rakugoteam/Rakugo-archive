## Rakugo

Rakugo Framework is inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) game template with addon for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

It has dialogue system, some extra tools, nodes, gui and features that most games have auto of the box

The idea is to have a ready to use plug-in for stories, so developers can create narrative driven games with all the amazing features and tools of Godot 3.1+.

Now you can support this project by buing it on [itch.io](https://jebedaia.itch.io/rakugo).

You can download 2.0 for Godot 3.1 [here](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo/releases).

## Showcase

Games using Rakugo v 0.9.x :
- [**Space drive beats**](https://plopsis.itch.io/space-drive-beats)
- [**Bot Saves Dream**](https://plopsis.itch.io/curator-bot)

If your game uses Rakugo write to me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/K9gvjdg).

Games using Rakugo v 2.0.x :
- [**The Question: Rakugo Editon**](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo/tree/the-question-1.2)

## The Question: Rakugo Editon

This is game is a demo of VN Rakugo Template.
This template is port of Ren'Py game [*The Question*](https://games.renpy.org/game/question).

## Story driven games

It means games that are for example:

- [Visual Novels](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo/tree/the-question) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/VN-100%25-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)
- Click & Point Adventures ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adv-25%25-yellowgreen.svg?style=flat-square)
- RPG ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/RPG-40%25-green.svg?style=flat-square)

You can use it with:
- GDScript
- RakugoScript (ToDo)
- VisualScript (ToDo)

## FAQ:

**Q:** So it's about adding a refined writing and dialogue system to the engine? </p>
**A:** Yes, and more - nodes, objects and funcs to make easy to provide mechanics like in point&click and rpgs.

**Q:** As a scenarist, what would I gain from using Rakugo over Ren'Py or Twine ? </p>
**A:** It is made as godot addon - you can use all godot features.
You can make your game 2d, 2.5d or 3d - you can only 2d in Ren'Py.
You can easy add minigames or mix it with other game genre.
It will have mechanics for point&click games and rpgs - Ren'Py and Twine are only for vn.
This project's dialog functions can do more than Ren'Py's equivalents.

**Q:** How does the framework interact with the engine ? </p>
**A:** For now this framework is a singleton and a collection of special nodes. There is also gui include in example project that is connected with the framework and has all functions like in a Ren'Py game.

**Q:** Is it easy to use ?</p>
**A:** For now it is not that easy as I want it to be, but I am working to make it use RakugoScript (this framework's own language) and visual script.
